# Experiments on french to english translation

Migration of OpenNMT from Torch (obsolete) to PyTorch is necessary. A lot of things changed:

1. Parameters are not the same. epoch/steps removed, now.
1. NN snapshots can't be transfered, because old ones need Torch/Cuda to convert to no GPU basic snapshot but Cuda was upgraded... Conversion is no more possible.

Seed 0 is now used everywere possible to reproduce exactly (?) all experiments.

## Scripts
`preprocess.sh` to preprocess data (chunkify, etc)

`training.sh` to train NN.

`translate.sh` to translate data.

## Patching Translation module to mimic `-replace_unk_tagged`
Missing `-replace_unk_tagged` option. Lot of users complains about it.
Patch added to `Translation.py` in installed distrib.

File : `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/OpenNMT_py-1.0.0rc1-py3.7.egg/onmt/translate/translation.py`

Original renamed `translation.py.orig`
