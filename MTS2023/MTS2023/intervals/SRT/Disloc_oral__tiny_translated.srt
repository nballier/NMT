39
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,540

73
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,540

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,380
The lecture is passed.

75
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,700
A child is precious and fragile.

76
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,700
A child is precious and fragile.

77
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,540
A lot of a child.

78
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,300
A lot of a child.

79
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,020
A work, a medicine,

80
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,060

81
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,760

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,120
The levels of people, I be very clear that they had to fight to burn.

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,220
Johnson and his son and back.

86
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,980
I just gave him sun down.

87
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,120
It was a reading of how high he was.

88
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,040
Oh, it had a good reading of what he was right in vain...

89
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,880

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,020
So, this commotion came from one moment.

97
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,200
I called him and asked him to bring the ribbon.

98
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,280
